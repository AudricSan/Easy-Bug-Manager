<u>**Introduction**</u>

```
Easy Bug Manager is a tool for bug management.
```

If you're developing a software, web page, or game, Easy Bug Manager is your best choice to help you manage bugs in your project.
If you're not a developer, you can also use our product as a simple and cute To-do software. It helps you record and manage what you need to do.
If you are an artist, you can also use our software to help you manage your ideas.

<br/>

<u>**Features**</u>

- Simple and easy to use
- Lovely and concise interface

<br/>

<u>**What are the functions of this software?**</u>

It can record and manage bugs in your project.
Step 1: Enter the description of the bug
Step 2: Set the priority of the bug
Step 3: Let’s kill bugs one by one according to the priority!

<br/>

**<u>If you're a programmer</u>**

You can record all bugs in this software and assign priority and schedule for each bug.
Compared with other same type software, our product has the following merits:

- Lovely interface, simple operation.
- In the design of the software, only really useful elements were remained. You do not have to fill in lots of options, but just fill in the name and priority of the bug. Then you can record a bug.
- You do not have to consider for too much. Just simply record the bug, and then solve it.
- To make boring things warm , "Polar Bear Debugging" was added in the software (it is inspired by "Rubber Duck Debugging"). You can type in your thoughts on the bug as if you were chatting with a friend, then the Bug will reply you with its thoughts and encouragement. With friendly chat, your train of thought will be clearer! Isn't it great to debug with chat?

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

## Save

The software is saved automatically.

```
Note:
Because this software is developed and maintained by individuals.
Therefore, we hope that users can make more backups of project files to prevent accidental loss and damage of project files.
Thank you very much for your understanding.
```

```
Note:
If your project file is corrupted, you can check the "Project File" chapter, maybe there is a way to recover part of the data.
```

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

## Project files

When you create a new project, the software will automatically create a [project folder] for you in the folder you specify.

In this [project folder], there are these things:

| Name              | Description                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Bug `(folder)`    | All [Bug data] in the project   |
| Image `(folder)`  | All [Image file] in the project |
| Record `(folder)` | All [Chat data] in the project  |
| Backup `(folder)` | [Backup data]                   |
| *.bugs `(File)`   | [Project data]                  |

<br/>

<br/>

## Sort

The software uses **multiple sort**  :

Sorting first considers "progress", 

second considers "priority", 

and third considers "create time" or "update time".

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

## Refresh button & Turn button

When a bug is changed, the bug will stay on the current page temporarily.

```
When you change the progress or priority of a bug, although the bug may no longer belong to this page, for the convenience of operation, the location of the bug will not change for the time being.
```

<br/>

This bug will be temporarily in the state of the following picture:

```
This picture shows that this bug may not belong here, but for convenience, this bug is temporarily displayed here ↓
```

<br/>

## Networking

The entire software does not require networking. This software does not have any servers, and the software is open source, so we cannot get your privacy through this software, please rest assured ~

```
The premise is that you need to download this software on our official website:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1175080/Easy_Bug_Manager/
https://github.com/xujiangjiang/Easy-Bug-Manager
```

```
note:
If you are using the Steam version, because the software is connected to the Steam platform SDK, Steam may make the software have some networking features.
However, the software itself does not have networking capabilities.
```

<br/>

The software is open-sourced, so you can find the source code on Github.

Github：https://github.com/xujiangjiang/Easy-Bug-Manager

<br/>

<br/>

**In order to better express my meaning, I have kept the original Chinese: **

整个软件都不需要联网，这个软件没有任何的服务器，而且软件是开源的，

所以我们没办法通个这个软件获取到你的隐私，请放心~

```
前提是你需要在我们的官方网站中，下载这个软件：
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1175080/Easy_Bug_Manager/
https://github.com/xujiangjiang/Easy-Bug-Manager
```

```
注意：
如果你使用的是Steam版本，因为软件接入了Steam平台的SDK，因此Steam可能会让软件有些联网功能。
但是，软件本身没有联网的功能。
```

<br/>

这款软件是开源的，因此，你可以在Github网站上找到这款软件的源代码。

Github：https://github.com/xujiangjiang/Easy-Bug-Manager

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

## Sync / Collaborative

Easy Bug Manager software supports third-party version control software.

```
(Eg: Git, TortoiseSVN, GitHub Desktop, Nutstore, etc.)
```

This is a troublesome chapter.
If you are a personal developer, if you only use this software as a todo software, if you do not need collaboration, if you do not understand third-party version control software, then you can skip this chapter.

<br/>

<br/>

### [What is a Collaborative Mode? ]

In order for Easy Bug Manager to support third-party version control software, we must enable Collaborative Mode.

When you open the project and enable the collaborative mode, all changes to the project files will be displayed in the software in real time.

```
Note:
If you enable Collaborative Mode, This software will consume more computer system performance, and more small files will be generated in the project file. 
```

```
Note:
Collaborative Mode is currently in beta test, there may be some defects.Hope you can put up with us more, welcome to give us more suggestions, thank you very much!
```

<br/>

<br/>

### [How to Enable? ]

**Step 1 : ** Click the [Create Project] button to open the Create Project interface.

![](Image/46.png)

<br/>

**Step 2 : ** Click the [Advanced Options] button to open the Advanced Options Panel.

![](Image/47.png)

<br/>

**Step 3 : ** We check the [Collaborative Mode] option. In this way, this project has become a project that supports Collaborative Mode!

![](Image/48.png)

<br/>

**Step 4 : ** When we open this project, the software automatically enables the Collaborative Mode.

```
(When we open a project that supports Collaborative Mode, the software automatically enables the Collaborative Mode.)
(If you see the [Collaborative Mode] button in the upper left corner of the software, it means that the software has enabled the Collaborative Mode.)
```

![](Image/49.png)

<br/>

<br/>

### [ How to Use? ]

No action is required. When your project file changes, the changes will be automatically displayed in the software.

<br/>

<br/>

### [ How to Close? ]

When you close a project, the Collaborative Mode automatically closes.

<br/>

**Only 1 step : ** Click the [Close] button in the software to close the project, and it will automatically close the Collaborative Mode!

```
You can also close the project by exiting the software directly.
```

![](Image/50.png)

<br/>

<br/>

### [ Need Networking?  ]

The entire software does not require networking. This software does not have any servers, and the software is open source, so we cannot get your privacy through this software, please rest assured ~*(For details, please refer to the "Networking" chapter)*

The role of this Collaborative Mode is to support third-party version control software.

```
If you are still not assured, here is the implementation idea of this function:
This functionality is implemented using the .Net FileSystemWatcher class.
The software uses this class to monitor the files in the project. If the files have changed, then we display these changes in the software.
The software will only monitor the current project file and will not monitor other files.
"Monitor" is a feature provided by .Net, which means: if your file changes, it will notify the software.
These functions are all completed in your computer. For more details, you can see the CollaborationSystem.cs file in the source code.
```

<br/>

<br/>

**In order to better express my meaning, I have kept the original Chinese: **

整个软件都不需要联网，这个软件没有任何的服务器，而且软件是开源的，

所以我们没办法通个这个软件获取到你的隐私，请放心~*（具体请看文档的“联网”章节）*

这个协同合作模式仅仅是支持第三方的版本控制软件。

```
如果你还不放心，这里是这个功能的实现思路：
这个功能是用.Net的FileSystemWatcher类实现的。
软件通过这个类，来对项目中的文件进行监测，如果文件发生了更改，那么我们就把这些更改显示在软件中。
软件只会监测当前的项目文件，不会监测其他的文件。
这里说的“监测”是.Net提供的一个功能，意思是：如果你的文件发生了更改，就会通知软件。
这些逻辑都是在你的电脑中完成的，更详细的内容你可以看源代码中的CollaborationSystem.cs文件。
```

<br/>

<br/>
