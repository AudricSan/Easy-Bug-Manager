Compared with other same type software, our product has the following merits:

- Lovely interface, simple operation.
- In the design of the software, only really useful elements were remained. You do not have to fill in lots of options, but just fill in the name and priority of the bug. Then you can record a bug.
- You do not have to consider for too much. Just simply record the bug, and then solve it.
- To make boring things warm , "Polar Bear Debugging" was added in the software (it is inspired by "Rubber Duck Debugging"). You can type in your thoughts on the bug as if you were chatting with a friend, then the Bug will reply you with its thoughts and encouragement. With friendly chat, your train of thought will be clearer! Isn't it great to debug with chat?
